The purpose of this memorandum is to illustrate the RF link performance between $$MISSIONNAME$$ and $$NETWORKNAME$$. $$NETWORKNAME$$ will provide service to $$MISSIONNAME$$ for the full duration of its operational lifetime. The $$MISSIONNAME$$ $$FREQUENCYBAND$$ downlink will provide service when the line-of-sight exists.

The purpose of this memorandum is to illustrate the RF link performance between $$MISSIONNAME$$ and $$NETWORKNAME$$. The $$NETWORKNAME$$ will provide angle data tracking services for $$MISSIONNAME$$ during its Launch and Early Orbit Phase (LEOP). The $$MISSIONNAME$$-$$NETWORKNAME$$ $$FREQUENCYBAND$$ downlink will provide angle tracking capabilities when line-of-sight exists, the participating station antenna elevation angle to $$MISSIONNAME$$ is greater than $$INCLINATION$$ and $$MISSIONNAME$$ is above the participating station local antenna mask.
